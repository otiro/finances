## Next Steps for QA

# On Raspberry Pi (production):
cd /home/julien/finances/backend

# Check for TypeScript errors
# Expected: 0 errors ‚úÖ
```

### Phase 3: API Testing
```bash
# Get debts for a household
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/households/{householdId}/debts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Expected response includes debts with:
# - id (valid UUID, not placeholder)

## Troubleshooting Quick Links

### If API returns 404 on checkbox click:
1. Check browser network tab for actual response
2. Verify API returns debts with valid `id` field
3. See [FLUX_8-10_QUICK_START.md](./FLUX_8-10_QUICK_START.md) troubleshooting

### If debts don't display:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server logs for Prisma errors
3. Verify BalancingRecords exist in database
4. See [TESTING_FLUX_8-10_FIX.md](./TESTING_FLUX_8-10_FIX.md) troubleshooting

### If householdId is undefined:
Status: ‚úÖ FIXED in this release
- This was the bug that was fixed
- If still seeing this error, check that you have v0.4.9f or later
