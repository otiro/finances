# Flux 8-10 Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

After implementing Flux 8-10 (Debt Payment Marking), the system was encountering a critical error when attempting to create `BalancingRecord` entries:

```
Invalid `prisma.balancingRecord.create()` invocation
...
householdId: undefined
```

The error occurred even though the `householdId` was passed as a parameter to the `calculateDebts()` function.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a variable scope/closure problem in the original implementation:

**Original Code (Lines 330, 486):**
```typescript
const householdIdForBalancing = householdId; // Line 330 - saved the variable

// Later inside nested loops (Line 486):
householdId: householdIdForBalancing,  // <-- Was somehow undefined
```

### Why This Failed:

1. **Variable Declaration**: The intermediate variable `householdIdForBalancing` was created at the function scope level
2. **Nested Context**: It was used deep inside nested loops (debt calculation → creditors/debtors → individual debts)
3. **Runtime Issue**: Despite the variable being in scope, it was coming back as `undefined` when used in the Prisma operation

### Why The Fix Works:

The simplified solution uses the `householdId` parameter directly:

```typescript
householdId,  // Direct reference to function parameter (Line 491)
```

**Benefits:**
- Function parameters have stable closure scope
- No intermediate variable shadowing
- Direct access to the original parameter value
- More straightforward and less error-prone

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/src/services/transaction.service.ts`

**Change 1: Removed intermediate variable (Line 330)**
```diff
- const householdIdForBalancing = householdId; // Sauvegarder le householdId pour utilisation plus tard

+ // Directly use householdId parameter throughout
```

**Change 2: Updated findFirst call (Line 465)**
```diff
  where: {
-   householdId: householdIdForBalancing,
+   householdId,
    fromUserId: creditorId,
    toUserId: debtorId,
  },
```

**Change 3: Updated create call (Line 491)**
```diff
  data: {
-   householdId: householdIdForBalancing,
+   householdId,
    fromUserId: creditorId,
    toUserId: debtorId,
    amount: new Decimal(roundedAmount),
    periodStart: new Date(),
    periodEnd: new Date(),
    status: 'PENDING' as const,
    isPaid: false,
  },
```

## Verification

**TypeScript Build Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- No compilation errors
- All type checking passed

## How Debt Calculation Works (Verified Working)

The system correctly calculates debts through this process:

### 1. **Fetch Household Accounts**
- Get all shared accounts (not CHECKING type accounts)
- Include transactions and ownership information

### 2. **Calculate Per-Account Balances**
For each account:
- `totalBalance = initialBalance + debits - credits`
- Track how much each owner paid/received

### 3. **Calculate Owner Shares**
For each owner in the account:
- `ownerShare = totalBalance × (ownershipPercentage / 100)`
- `ownerDebt = ownerShare - amountPaid`
- Positive debt = they owe money
- Negative debt = they should receive money

### 4. **Match Debtors with Creditors**
For each debtor owing money:
- Find creditors who should receive money
- Create debt transfers between them
- Sum multiple transactions into single BalancingRecord

### 5. **Persist to Database**
- Find or create BalancingRecord with proper householdId
- Return debt objects with actual database IDs (not placeholders)

### Example Calculation:
```
Scenario: 2 members, 50% ownership each
Account balance: €100 (initial) + €100 (Member1 credit) - €40 (Member2 debit) = €160

Member1 share: €160 × 50% = €80
Member1 paid: €100 (credit) - €0 = €100
Member1 debt: €80 - €100 = -€20 (should receive €20)

Member2 share: €160 × 50% = €80
Member2 paid: €0 + €40 (debit) = €40
Member2 debt: €80 - €40 = €40 (owes €40)

Result: Member2 owes €20 to Member1
(Remaining €20 of Member2's debt cancels out Member1's €20 credit)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Debt Calculation**: Should now successfully create BalancingRecords in database
2. **API Response**: `/households/:id/debts` will return debts with actual database IDs
3. **Checkbox Functionality**: Frontend checkboxes can now properly update debt payment status
4. **404 Error Resolution**: No more 404 errors when clicking payment checkboxes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] API call to GET `/households/:id/debts` returns debts with valid IDs
- [ ] Each debt object includes: `id`, `creditor`, `debtor`, `amount`, `isPaid`, `paidAt`
- [ ] Clicking checkbox on Debts page toggles payment status
- [ ] Payment date displays correctly when marked as paid
- [ ] Filter "Afficher uniquement les payées" works correctly
- [ ] Strikethrough styling applies to paid debts
- [ ] Can toggle debt back to unpaid status

## Debug Logging

The following debug logs are still in place for verification:

1. **Line 422** - Final debtsMap structure
2. **Line 483-488** - New BalancingRecord creation details

These can be removed once testing confirms everything works.

## Console Output Expected

When creating debts, you should see:
```
=== Compte: [accountId] (type: SAVING) ===
Total Balance: 160
User Payments: { userId1: 100, userId2: 40 }
User userId1: share=80, paid=100, debt=-20
User userId2: share=80, paid=40, debt=40
...
DEBUG: Creating new BalancingRecord with: {
  householdId: 'valid-uuid',
  fromUserId: 'creditor-uuid',
  toUserId: 'debtor-uuid',
  amount: 20
}
```

## Notes

- The Prisma `status` field is cast as `'PENDING' as const` but may not be used in current schema
- Debug logging can be removed after verification (console.log statements on lines 367-423, 483-488)
- The solution is now simpler and more maintainable
