## üéØ What is Flux 8-10?

**Flux 8-10** implements debt payment tracking for the finances application:

- **Flux 8**: Mark debts as paid
- **Flux 9**: Toggle payment status on/off
- **Flux 10**: View payment history

### Features

‚úÖ **Mark Debts as Paid**: Click checkbox to update payment status
‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Green background, strikethrough for paid debts
‚úÖ **Payment Timestamps**: Track when debts were marked as paid
‚úÖ **Filter by Status**: Show only paid/unpaid debts
‚úÖ **Per-Person Summary**: See net balance for each person
‚úÖ **Authorization**: Only creditors and debtors can mark debts
‚úÖ **Persistence**: Payment status saved to database

## üêõ Bug Fixed in This Session

**Problem**: `householdId` was undefined when creating BalancingRecord entries

**Cause**: Variable scope issue with intermediate variable in nested loops

**Solution**: Use function parameter directly instead of intermediate variable

**Result**: ‚úÖ BalancingRecords now persist correctly with valid householdId

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Build the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the API
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/households/{householdId}/debts
```

### 4. Verify the Fix
- Check debug logs for valid householdId (not undefined)
- Look for: `DEBUG: Creating new BalancingRecord with: { householdId: 'valid-uuid'...`

### 5. Test the UI
- Go to "Dettes et remboursements" page
- Click checkbox next to a debt
- Should mark as paid with green styling

See [FLUX_8-10_QUICK_START.md](./FLUX_8-10_QUICK_START.md) for detailed steps.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] Backend built successfully
- [ ] Backend server running
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Frontend built successfully

### Backend Testing
- [ ] GET `/api/households/:id/debts` returns debts with valid IDs
- [ ] Debug logs show `householdId` as valid UUID
- [ ] No Prisma errors in logs

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Debts page loads without errors
- [ ] Debts display correctly
- [ ] Checkbox can be clicked
- [ ] Payment status updates after click
- [ ] Green styling applied to paid debts
- [ ] Filter works correctly
- [ ] Summary per person is accurate

### Advanced Testing
- [ ] Multiple households work correctly
- [ ] Authorization checks work (403 for unauthorized)
- [ ] Invalid IDs return 404
- [ ] No regression in other features

See [TESTING_FLUX_8-10_FIX.md](./TESTING_FLUX_8-10_FIX.md) for detailed procedures.

## üìä Data Flow

### Creating a Debt

```
1. calculateDebts() fetches accounts
2. Calculates ownership shares and payments
3. Matches debtors with creditors
4. Creates BalancingRecord in database
5. Returns debt with real ID (not placeholder)
```

### Marking Debt as Paid

```
1. User clicks checkbox on debt
2. Frontend calls markDebtAsPaid() API
3. Backend verifies authorization
4. Updates isPaid=true, paidAt=NOW()
5. Returns updated debt
6. Frontend updates UI with styling
```

See [FLUX_8-10_VISUAL_GUIDE.md](./FLUX_8-10_VISUAL_GUIDE.md) for detailed diagrams.

## üîê Security

### Authorization Checks

1. **Household Membership**: User must be member of household
2. **Debt Involvement**: User must be creditor or debtor
3. **Authorization Level**: Members can only access their household debts

### Permission Levels

- **Admin**: Can manage debts in their household
- **Member**: Can mark their own debts
- **Non-member**: No access (403 Forbidden)

## üì± API Endpoints

### GET /api/households/:id/debts
Get all debts for a household

**Response**: Array of debts with id, creditor, debtor, amount, isPaid, paidAt

### PATCH /api/households/:id/balancing-records/:recordId/mark-paid
Mark a debt as paid or unpaid

**Request**: `{ isPaid: boolean }`
**Response**: Updated debt object

See [FLUX_8-10_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](./FLUX_8-10_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md#api-endpoints) for full details.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### BalancingRecord (New Fields)

```sql
isPaid      BOOLEAN DEFAULT false     -- Payment status
paidAt      DATETIME                  -- When marked as paid
```

Both fields were added via Prisma migration.

See [FLUX_8-10_VISUAL_GUIDE.md](./FLUX_8-10_VISUAL_GUIDE.md#database-schema) for full schema.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Error on Checkbox Click
**Solution**: Verify API returns debts with valid `id` field, not placeholder

### Issue: Debts Not Showing
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify BalancingRecords exist in database

### Issue: householdId Undefined (Original Bug)
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
**Fix**: Use householdId parameter directly instead of intermediate variable

See [FLUX_8-10_FIX_SUMMARY.md](./FLUX_8-10_FIX_SUMMARY.md#troubleshooting) for more details.

## üìù Next Steps

### After Fix Verification

1. **Remove Debug Logging**
   - Delete console.log statements from calculateDebts() (lines 367-423)
   - Delete debug logging from BalancingRecord creation (lines 483-488)
   - Rebuild: `npm run build`

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   - Follow [TESTING_FLUX_8-10_FIX.md](./TESTING_FLUX_8-10_FIX.md)
   - Complete all tests from checklist

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Update version to v0.3.6
   - Create changelog entry
   - Deploy to production environment

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Payment confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Payment notes/comments
- [ ] Partial payment support
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Payment history timeline
- [ ] Automatic settlement suggestions
